We are a group of 48 (pls check the correctness of the class number as of when we started or graduated) corporate executives (leaders?) brought together since 2012 by sheer Providence of the Almighty God to undertake the 25th edition of the Advanced Management Programme of the school. Since then, we’ve all stuck together and pursing common interests</li>
